# jaytwo.ejson

A .NET Core version of [Shoppify's ejson](https://github.com/Shopify/ejson).

I read their [blog post](https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/secrets-at-shopify-introducing-ejson) and thought it was a good idea.  But I'm a .NET developer and mainly work on Windows, so installing with `gem` or a `.deb` isn't as practical in my world.
